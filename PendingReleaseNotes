v10.0.0
======

* The rbd CLI no longer accepts the deprecated '--image-features' option
  during create, import, and clone operations.  The '--image-feature'
  option should be used instead.

* The 'send_pg_creates' and 'map_pg_creates' mon CLI commands are
  obsolete and no longer supported.

* A new configure option 'mon_election_timeout' is added to specifically
  limit max waiting time of monitor election process, which was previously
  restricted by 'mon_lease'.

* The rbd legacy image format (version 1) is deprecated with the Jewel release.
  Attempting to create a new version 1 RBD image will result in a warning.
  Future releases of Ceph will remove support for version 1 RBD images.

v9.3.0
======
* Some symbols wrongly exposed by librados in v9.1.0 and v9.2.0 were removed.
  If you compiled your own application against librados shipped with these
  releases, it is very likely referencing these removed symbols. So you will
  need to recompile it.
